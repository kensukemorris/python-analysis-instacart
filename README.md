# python-analysis-instacart
Descriptive analysis to identify customer segments using data from Instacart.

#Project Brief
Note: this analysis do was conducted using publicly available data. The contents of this project are for educational purposes and do not reflect the infelct the internal operations of Instacart.

## Context
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database
along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the
same methods, and theyâ€™re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target
different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect
on the sale of their products. Your analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to
ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.

## Key Questions
The stakeholders would like to be able to answer the following key questions:

<ol>
  <li> The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
  day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at 
  times when there are fewer orders. </li>

  <li> They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
  spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
  these times. </li> 

  <li> Instacart has alot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
  use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts. </li> 

  <li> Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
  and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
  product orders. </li> 

  <li> The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
  customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. </li> 
</ol>
